The files in this directory are for reproducing the results in 
the manuscript entitled "Canonical and Noncanonical Hamiltonian Operator Inference"
by A. Gruber, I. Tezaur and M. Gunzburger. 

The do-cmake-trilinos and do-cmake-albany are configure 
scripts for the Trilinos and Albany-LCM codes, which can be
checked out on github at the following URLs respectively: 

https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos
https://github.com/sandialabs/LCM

To generate the results in the paper, the following shas of these libraries
were used: 

79d3a68bd6176c80ae10e693cd15b1040f6be10f (Trilinos)
322132d613777d48b85d70ed95c0ff4a07c8aed0 (Albany)

Once building the Albany executable, the 3D linear elastic cantilever 
plate problem can be reproduced by running 

./Albany beam_zVelIC.yaml 

Absolute errors plotted in the paper were calculated using netcdf's 'algebra' 
utility using the alg.i file fond in this directory.
